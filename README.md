### Why we exist

We're just trying to be a resource in helping to foster a community in Seattle. **All input is welcome!**

### Why our website is on GitHub
In treating our founders as our customers, we often think about how to build as much trust as possible with them. We believe transparency — in how we think, what we believe and why — is the first step to that trust.

So, a few months after we started our fund, when we were writing an [operating manual](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md) for ourselves (covering everything from check sizes, to diligence questions, core beliefs, etc.), we decided to take a chance and open source it. Founders told us, again and again, how much time it saved to have facts out in the open, how it helped them decide whether to work with us. (The ones who want to skip talking to us also save a step, which is terrific. Founder time is precious.) We started seeing stars and forks, and decided to go even further.

We've moved our entire web presence to GitHub to become even more transparent. Here, you can see how things have changed over time, propose improvements, or even take our ideas and make them your own (the investments are ours, though). You can also see the things you'd usually find on a venture investor's website, like [a list of our founders](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/2%20-%20In%20our%20portfolio.md) and [the questions we ask ourselves when evaluating startups](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/3%20-%20Criteria%20for%20investing.md). We're grateful you're taking the time to learn about us.

**So here you are. When in doubt, as they say, read the (ahem) manual. :)**

### Questions?

Our founders requested an anonymous way to ask us questions, so we're providing it for you, too. [Right here](http://tiny.cc/AUA).  

(If we've already answered the question in our manual, e.g., "how should I get in touch with you?" then we will respectfully ignore the question.)
